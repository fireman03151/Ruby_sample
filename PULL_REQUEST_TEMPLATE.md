If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- Replace the `[ ]` with a `[x]` once you’ve completed each step. -->
